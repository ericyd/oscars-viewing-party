## What is this directory?

It is auto-generated by an Atlas command, `atlas migrate diff full_schema --env local`.

The purpose of this is that if someone didn't want to install Atlas just to create a DB,
there is a reference to the raw SQL commands to do the same thing.

Just a convenience thing, Atlas is kind of a confusing tool IMO so keeping this in case
I decide to abandon it and use [dbmate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate) or something else.
